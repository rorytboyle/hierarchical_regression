# hierarchical_regression
Python code for hierarchical multiple linear regressions. This code has been checked and validated against the same analysis conducted in SPSS. The code can be used as is currently (i.e. the items on the to-do list are future projects to further improve performance).

This code was used for an analysis in the following paper: Boyle et al. (2021). Verbal intelligence is a more robust cross-sectional measure of cognitive reserve than level of education in healthy older adults. Alzheimer's Research and Therapy. https://doi.org/10.1186%2Fs13195-021-00870-z
